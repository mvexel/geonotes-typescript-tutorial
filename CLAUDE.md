# TypeScript Learning Project: Building GeoNotes API

This project is focused on learning TypeScript by building a sophisticated location-based API called GeoNotes from scratch. The goal is to understand TypeScript fundamentals through practical application while building enterprise-grade software architecture.

## General instructions
- You MUST add forward links to the next lesson or step at the end of this 
- You MUST assume the audience is a fairly senior software developer with experience in at least one other language building back end software but little or no experience with enterprise scale concerns and related infrastructure.
- You MUST ensure consistent teaching and writing style throughout
- You MUST add references to the official documentation whenever a new concept is introduced.
- You MUST demonstrate how Typescript differs from JavaScript wherever possible.
- You MUST NOT be overly obsequious, stay to the point, but do explain concepts in depth. 
- You MUST NOT second guessing earlier decisions about the project architecture, but if we do, revisit earlier chapters to ensure consistency.

## Learning Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build a complete GeoNotes API using TypeScript/Node.js while learning TypeScript concepts progressively. We'll create a system that allows users to submit location-based notes about real-world issues and observations.

### Learning Structure
All learning materials are organized under the project root with structured lessons, exercises, and references.

## What We're Building: GeoNotes API Overview
GeoNotes is an enterprise-grade REST API for submitting "geonotes" - location-based reports that can be anything a human or system would want to communicate about a specific place. Think of it as a global issue reporting system where users can:

- **Submit notes** with geographic coordinates and descriptions
- **Track note lifecycle** (new → taken → closed)
- **Manage privacy** (public vs private notes)
- **Handle bulk operations** for importing large datasets
- **Authenticate users** with JWT tokens
- **Monitor system health** with metrics and logging

### Target Architecture
- **Framework**: Modern Node.js framework (NestJS or Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
- **Architecture**: Service layer, repository pattern, dependency injection
- **Features**: JWT auth, bulk operations, privacy system, monitoring, comprehensive testing
- **Scale**: Designed for millions to billions of notes globally

## TypeScript Learning Approach

### Phase 1: TypeScript Fundamentals
- Type system, interfaces, generics
- Classes and OOP patterns
- Module system and project setup

### Phase 2: Node.js Ecosystem
- Project configuration and tooling
- Package management and build systems
- Development workflow setup

### Phase 3: Framework Selection & Architecture
- Compare Express, NestJS, Fastify
- Implement similar patterns to FastAPI
- Set up routing, middleware, dependency injection

### Phase 4: Database Integration
- ORM selection (Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle)
- Schema migration from SQLModel
- PostGIS spatial data handling

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Authentication and security
- Bulk operations and job processing
- Monitoring and observability
- Comprehensive testing

## Development Guidelines

### File Organization
- **Learning materials**: project root, onw directory per phase
- **TypeScript implementation**: `ts-geonotes/` (to be created)
- **API documentation**: Detailed specifications for what we're building

### Learning Principles
- **Hands-on approach**: Write code for every concept learned
- **Incremental complexity**: Start simple, add sophistication gradually
- **Real-world patterns**: Focus on enterprise-grade architecture from the start
- **Documentation**: Each lesson includes references and examples

### Progress Tracking
- Use TodoWrite tool to track learning milestones
- Create practical exercises for each concept
- Build working features that can be tested and validated

## Success Criteria
1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compilation without errors
2. **API Compatibility**: 100% feature parity with Python version
3. **Performance**: Equivalent or better than current system
4. **Code Quality**: Proper testing, error handling, and documentation
5. **Architecture**: Maintainable, scalable enterprise patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review the project overview to understand what we're building
2. Begin with TypeScript fundamentals
3. Create practical exercises based on GeoNotes domain concepts
4. Build incrementally toward full API implementation
