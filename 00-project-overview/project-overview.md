- Frontend development knowledge
- Docker or containerization (though helpful)
- Cloud deployment experience (covered later)

## Why This Project

Instead of toy examples, you'll build infrastructure software with real-world complexity. GeoNotes handles the same patterns found in production systems like municipal 311 APIs, crowdsourced mapping platforms, and field research tools.

## The Story Behind GeoNotes

The inspiration comes from a fundamental human need: we all notice things about the world around us, but most observations disappear into the void.

You see a dangerous pothole on your bike ride to work. A neighbor notices that a streetlight has been broken for weeks. A visitor discovers an amazing local business that deserves recognition. A researcher spots an environmental change worth documenting.

**What if all these observations could find their proper home?**

That's the vision - creating infrastructure that transforms casual observations into actionable, organized information tied to specific places on Earth.

## Real-World Impact

Systems like the one you'll build are already changing the world:

- **Boston's 311 system** handles over 200,000 civic reports annually
- **OpenStreetMap Notes** have generated millions of map improvements worldwide  
- **eBird** has collected over 1 billion bird observations for scientific research
- **Waze** crowdsources traffic data from 140 million active users

The patterns you'll learn building GeoNotes power these massive, impactful systems.

## The Simple Core Concept

At its heart, a "geonote" is just a message tied to coordinates:

```json
{
  "latitude": 40.7128,
  "longitude": -74.0060,
  "description": "Pothole blocking bike lane",
  "isPrivate": false,
  "userData": {
    "category": "infrastructure",
    "severity": "medium",
    "reporterType": "cyclist"
  }
}
```

But we'll build sophisticated features around this simple concept.

## What We'll Build Together

### 1. Core Note Management
- **Create notes** with coordinates, descriptions, and custom user data
- **Read notes** with geographic and text-based filtering
- **Update note status** as issues are addressed
- **Delete notes** when no longer relevant

### 2. Note Lifecycle
Notes progress through states:
- **new**: Just reported, needs attention
- **taken**: Someone is working on it
- **closed**: Issue resolved or note is complete
- **can reopen**: Closed notes can return to "new" if needed

### 3. User System
- **User registration** and authentication
- **JWT token-based** secure API access
- **Role-based permissions** (regular users vs admins)
- **User profiles** and settings

### 4. Privacy Features
- **Public notes**: Visible to everyone
- **Private notes**: Only visible to the creator
- **Quota system**: Limits on private note creation
- **Admin oversight**: Administrative controls

### 5. Geographic Features
- **Coordinate validation**: Ensure valid lat/lng values
- **Radius searching**: Find notes within X kilometers
- **Spatial indexing**: Fast geographic queries
- **PostGIS integration**: Advanced spatial operations

### 6. Bulk Operations
- **Bulk import**: Upload thousands of notes at once
- **Async processing**: Handle large operations in background
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor bulk operation status
- **Error reporting**: Detailed feedback on failed operations

### 7. Enterprise Features
- **Comprehensive logging**: Track all system activity
- **Metrics and monitoring**: Prometheus-compatible metrics
- **Health checks**: System status endpoints
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse
- **Input validation**: Secure data handling

## Data Models

### Note with Extensible User Data
```typescript
interface Note {
  id: number;
  latitude: number;      // -90 to 90
  longitude: number;     // -180 to 180
  description: string;   // What's being reported
  state: "new" | "taken" | "closed";
  isPrivate: boolean;
  ownerId?: number;      // null for anonymous notes
  userData: Record<string, any>;  // Extensible user-defined data
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

The `userData` field allows users to attach any structured data they need:

```typescript
// Infrastructure report
{
  userData: {
    category: "road",
    severity: "high",
    estimatedCost: 500,
    affectedVehicles: ["car", "bike"]
  }
}

// Business listing
{
  userData: {
    businessType: "restaurant",
    cuisine: "italian",
    priceRange: "$$",
    hours: { mon: "9-21", tue: "9-21" }
  }
}

// Environmental observation
{
  userData: {
    species: "Pinus sylvestris",
    condition: "healthy",
    dbh: 45.2,
    coordinates: { precision: "gps" }
  }
}
```

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  disabled: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### API Responses
```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  success: boolean;
  message?: string;
}

interface PagedResponse<T> {
  items: T[];
  total: number;
  page: number;
  pageSize: number;
}
```

## Why This Will Change How You Think About Code

Building GeoNotes will teach you to think like a professional software architect:

**Scale First**: Every decision considers how the system will behave with millions of users and billions of data points.

**Real-World Constraints**: Geographic coordinates must be valid, user permissions must be enforced, and data integrity cannot be compromised.

**Production Concerns**: Logging, monitoring, security, and performance aren't afterthoughts - they're built in from day one.

**Type Safety**: Complex domain logic is expressed through TypeScript's type system, catching entire categories of bugs before they reach users.

## Why TypeScript?

**Type Safety**: Geographic coordinates must be valid numbers, user IDs must exist, note states must be one of specific values. TypeScript catches these errors before they reach production.

**Developer Experience**: Your editor becomes incredibly smart - autocomplete, refactoring, and error detection that makes development faster and more reliable.

**Team Collaboration**: Types serve as documentation, making it clear what data structures expect and return.

**Scalability**: As GeoNotes grows to handle millions of notes, TypeScript's tooling helps manage complexity.

## Your Transformation

When you complete this journey, you won't just know TypeScript syntax - you'll think differently about software:

- You'll automatically consider edge cases and error conditions
- You'll design APIs that are intuitive and impossible to misuse
- You'll write code that's self-documenting through intelligent type design
- You'll understand how to build systems that can grow from dozens to millions of users

## What You'll Gain

By the end of this journey, you'll have:

1. **A complete, production-ready API** with authentication, validation, monitoring, and comprehensive testing
2. **Deep TypeScript knowledge** that goes far beyond syntax to include advanced patterns and architectural thinking
3. **Professional development practices** including testing strategies, documentation, and deployment pipelines
4. **A portfolio project** that demonstrates enterprise-grade software engineering skills
5. **Confidence** to tackle any backend development challenge
