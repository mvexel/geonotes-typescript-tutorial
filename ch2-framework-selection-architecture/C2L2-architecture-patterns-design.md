# Lesson 2: Architecture Patterns & Design

## Overview

[Overview explaining how framework choice is just the beginning - the real challenge is organizing code for long-term maintainability and scalability. Discussion of how enterprise-grade APIs require thoughtful layering, separation of concerns, and patterns that support team collaboration. Should emphasize how TypeScript enables better architectural patterns through interfaces and dependency injection.]

## Learning Objectives
- Master layered architecture patterns for TypeScript APIs
- Implement repository and service patterns with proper typing
- Design dependency injection strategies
- Structure code for testability and maintainability
- Apply domain-driven design principles to GeoNotes

## The Need for Architectural Patterns

[Discussion of why architecture matters:
- Code organization at scale
- Team collaboration and code ownership
- Testing strategies and mock isolation
- Business logic separation from framework concerns
- Evolution and refactoring over time
- How TypeScript interfaces enable clean architecture]

## Layered Architecture Design

[Deep dive into organizing API layers:
- Presentation Layer (Controllers/Routes)
- Business Logic Layer (Services)
- Data Access Layer (Repositories)
- Domain Layer (Models/Entities)
- Infrastructure Layer (External services)
- How TypeScript interfaces define contracts between layers]

### Layer Responsibilities
```typescript
// Scaffold examples showing:
// Controller responsibilities and boundaries
// Service layer business logic
// Repository data access patterns
// Domain model definitions
```

## Repository Pattern with TypeScript

[Comprehensive coverage of repository pattern:
- Abstracting data access behind interfaces
- Generic repository implementations
- Specialized repositories for geospatial operations
- Unit of work patterns
- Transaction management
- Testing with mock repositories]

### Repository Implementation Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold repository interfaces and implementations
// Generic base repository
// GeoNotes-specific repository methods
// Spatial query abstractions
```

## Service Layer Design

[Service layer architecture:
- Business logic encapsulation
- Service composition and orchestration
- Domain service vs application service
- Error handling and validation strategies
- Transaction coordination
- Event-driven patterns]

### Service Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold service layer examples
// Business logic implementation
// Service composition patterns
// Error handling strategies
```

## Dependency Injection Patterns

[Dependency injection in TypeScript:
- Constructor injection patterns
- Interface-based dependencies
- Service locator vs dependency injection
- Circular dependency resolution
- Framework-specific DI (NestJS) vs manual DI (Express)
- Testing with dependency injection]

### DI Implementation
```typescript
// Scaffold DI container examples
// Interface definitions
// Service registration
// Framework integration
```

## Domain-Driven Design for GeoNotes

[Applying DDD principles:
- Identifying domain boundaries
- Aggregate design for spatial data
- Value objects for coordinates and measurements
- Domain events for note lifecycle
- Repository patterns for aggregates
- Application services vs domain services]

### Domain Model Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold domain model examples
// Aggregate root design
// Value objects
// Domain events
```

## Error Handling Architecture

[System-wide error handling:
- Error type hierarchies
- Error boundary patterns
- Logging and monitoring integration
- Client error vs server error handling
- Validation error propagation
- Global error handlers]

## Testing Architecture

[Testing strategy for layered architecture:
- Unit testing individual layers
- Integration testing between layers
- Mock strategies for external dependencies
- Test data builders and fixtures
- Testing spatial operations
- End-to-end testing approaches]

## Conclusion

[Summary of how these architectural patterns create a foundation for scalable, maintainable TypeScript APIs. Discussion of how the patterns work together and how they'll be applied in the GeoNotes implementation.]
