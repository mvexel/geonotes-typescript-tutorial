# Lesson 3: Request/Response Pipeline

## Overview

[Overview explaining how understanding the complete request/response pipeline is crucial for building reliable APIs. Discussion of how data flows from HTTP request through validation, business logic, database operations, and back to the client. Should emphasize how TypeScript's type system provides safety at each transformation step and how proper pipeline design prevents entire categories of bugs.]

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the complete HTTP request/response lifecycle
- Implement type-safe data transformation pipelines
- Design middleware chains with proper error handling
- Handle request validation and response formatting
- Optimize pipeline performance for geospatial operations

## HTTP Request Lifecycle

[Detailed walkthrough of request processing:
- HTTP request parsing and routing
- Middleware execution order
- Authentication and authorization gates
- Request validation and transformation
- Business logic execution
- Database operations and spatial queries
- Response formatting and serialization
- Error handling at each stage]

### Request Flow Diagram
```typescript
// Scaffold request flow examples
// Middleware chain execution
// Data transformation at each step
// Error handling propagation
```

## Request Validation Pipeline

[Comprehensive request validation strategy:
- Schema validation with TypeScript types
- Custom validators for geospatial data
- Sanitization and normalization
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Performance optimization for validation
- Framework-specific validation approaches]

### Validation Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold validation pipeline examples
// DTO definitions and decorators
// Custom validation rules
// Geospatial validation (coordinate bounds, etc.)
// Error formatting and response
```

## Middleware Architecture

[Deep dive into middleware patterns:
- Middleware execution order and dependencies
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, rate limiting)
- Error handling middleware
- Request context and state management
- Async middleware patterns
- Framework-specific middleware implementation]

### Middleware Implementation
```typescript
// Scaffold middleware examples
// Authentication middleware
// Logging and monitoring middleware
// Rate limiting for geospatial queries
// Error handling middleware
```

## Data Transformation Layers

[Type-safe data transformation:
- Request DTOs to domain models
- Domain models to database entities
- Database results to response DTOs
- Null safety and optional field handling
- Complex nested object transformations
- Performance considerations for large datasets]

### Transformation Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold transformation layer examples
// DTO to domain model mapping
// Entity to response DTO conversion
// Geospatial data serialization
// Error response formatting
```

## Response Formatting Strategies

[Consistent response formatting:
- Standard response envelope patterns
- Success and error response structures
- Pagination for geospatial queries
- Metadata inclusion (timing, version, etc.)
- Content negotiation and serialization
- Streaming responses for large datasets]

### Response Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold response formatting examples
// Standard response envelope
// Paginated responses
// Streaming geospatial data
// Error response consistency
```

## Authentication & Authorization Pipeline

[Security integration in the pipeline:
- JWT token validation and parsing
- User context creation and injection
- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- Geospatial access control (location-based permissions)
- Security middleware integration]

### Security Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold security pipeline examples
// JWT middleware implementation
// Authorization guards
// Context injection
// Permission checking
```

## Error Handling Pipeline

[Comprehensive error handling strategy:
- Error catching and transformation
- Structured error responses
- Logging and monitoring integration
- Client-safe error messages
- Development vs production error details
- Error recovery strategies]

### Error Handling Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold error handling examples
// Global error handlers
// Error transformation middleware
// Structured error responses
// Monitoring integration
```

## Performance Optimization

[Pipeline performance considerations:
- Request/response caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Geospatial query performance
- Memory management for large responses
- Streaming vs batching for bulk operations
- Monitoring and profiling pipeline performance]

### Performance Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold performance optimization examples
// Caching middleware
// Query optimization patterns
// Streaming response implementation
// Performance monitoring
```

## Testing the Pipeline

[Testing strategy for the complete pipeline:
- Unit testing individual middleware
- Integration testing pipeline flow
- End-to-end request/response testing
- Mock strategies for external dependencies
- Performance testing approaches
- Error scenario testing]

## Conclusion

[Summary of how the request/response pipeline forms the backbone of reliable API architecture. Discussion of how TypeScript provides safety at each transformation step and how proper pipeline design scales with application growth.]
