# Lesson 1: Express vs NestJS for GeoNotes

## Overview

[Overview explaining the critical importance of framework selection for a production API, the specific needs of a geospatial API like GeoNotes, and how this choice affects everything from development velocity to long-term maintainability. Should discuss the evolution from minimal frameworks to opinionated architectures and why this matters for TypeScript APIs.]

## Learning Objectives
- Compare Express and NestJS for building production TypeScript APIs
- Evaluate framework trade-offs specific to geospatial applications
- Understand how framework choice impacts TypeScript integration
- Make an informed decision for the GeoNotes API architecture

## Framework Philosophy: Minimal vs Opinionated

[Discussion of the fundamental philosophical differences:
- Express: Minimal, unopinionated, maximum flexibility
- NestJS: Opinionated, structured, enterprise-focused
- How these philosophies impact TypeScript development
- Trade-offs between flexibility and productivity]

## Express: The Minimalist Approach

[Deep dive into Express for TypeScript APIs:
- Setting up Express with TypeScript
- Manual dependency injection patterns
- Middleware architecture and typing
- Route organization and controller patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approaches
- Pros/cons for geospatial APIs]

### Express Code Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold basic Express setup examples
// Route handlers with TypeScript
// Middleware patterns
// Error handling
```

## NestJS: The Enterprise Framework

[Comprehensive look at NestJS:
- Decorators and metadata-driven development
- Built-in dependency injection
- Module system and organization
- Guards, interceptors, and pipes
- Built-in validation and transformation
- Testing infrastructure
- Pros/cons for production APIs]

### NestJS Code Examples
```typescript
// Scaffold NestJS controller examples
// Service injection patterns
// DTOs and validation
// Module organization
```

## Framework Decision Matrix

[Detailed comparison matrix covering:
- TypeScript integration quality
- Development velocity
- Learning curve
- Community and ecosystem
- Performance characteristics
- Scalability patterns
- Testing capabilities
- Production readiness
- Geospatial-specific considerations]

## Specific Considerations for GeoNotes

[Analysis of how each framework handles:
- Spatial data validation
- Complex query builders
- Background processing
- API documentation generation
- Authentication/authorization
- Database integration
- Monitoring and observability]

## Conclusion

[Summary of the decision-making process, recommendation for GeoNotes based on the specific requirements, and how this choice will impact subsequent lessons.]
