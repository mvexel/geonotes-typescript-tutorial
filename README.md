## Learning Approach

Each phase follows a consistent structure:
1. **Concept Introduction** - Theory and background
2. **Practical Examples** - Code demonstrations
3. **Hands-on Exercises** - Practice with GeoNotes context
4. **Reference Materials** - Documentation and further reading
5. **Progress Validation** - Checkpoints and assessments

## Getting Started

**Start here**: Begin with `00-project-overview/welcome.md` for an inspiring introduction to your learning journey.

Then read `00-project-overview/what-we-are-building.md` to understand the GeoNotes system.

After that, work through each phase sequentially starting with `01-fundamentals/lessons/01-typescript-basics.md`. Each lesson builds on previous concepts and relates directly to the GeoNotes API implementation.
