# TypeScript Learning Project: Building GeoNotes API

A comprehensive TypeScript course for experienced developers who want to learn production-grade API development. Build a complete location-based API from scratch while mastering TypeScript fundamentals, modern frameworks, and enterprise architecture patterns.

## What You'll Build

**GeoNotes** is a production-ready REST API for creating and managing location-based reports. Think municipal 311 systems, crowdsourced mapping tools, or field research platforms. You'll implement:

- **Spatial data handling** with PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- **Type-safe API endpoints** with comprehensive validation
- **Authentication & authorization** using JWT tokens
- **Bulk operations** for importing large datasets
- **Monitoring & observability** for production deployment
- **Complete test coverage** with unit and integration tests

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you're a fairly senior software developer with:
- Experience in at least one other programming language
- Understanding of API concepts and HTTP
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript (enough to be dangerous)
- No prior TypeScript or Node.js backend experience required

## Learning Approach

### Conceptual Foundation (Chapters 1-3)
Learn TypeScript fundamentals, framework selection, and project setup without exercises. Build understanding progressively before writing code.

### Hands-On Implementation (Chapters 4-12)
Starting in Chapter 4, each lesson ends with exercises that build toward a complete, deployable API. Every exercise reinforces the material and adds functionality.
