# Tutorial: Build a Geospatial API with TypeScript

I am learning Typescript to build a simple but powerful geospatial API. I have a Python background, but people way smarter than me suggested I try TypeScript. I know a fair amount about building production-grade APIs in Python, and enough JS to be dangerous. I am sharing my learning journey and reinforce what I learn by creating this tutorial.

## How I built this

I have a fairly complete Python version of this API, and I used Claude Code to frame a learning path to re-write this API in Typescript. The instructions are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Claude scaffolds the tutorial chapters for me, but I improve upon them as I learn. Sometimes, I will rewrite entire sections. Other times, Claude does a fairly good job explaining the concepts and I barely touch its writing.

## Get Started

Learn with me! Open the [introductory chapter](00-project-overview/project-overview.md) and we'll go from there.

## Paywall

The first couple of chapters will be free. I will charge a reasonable amount for the full course. I think this is fair; a lot of work goes in to creating good learning materials. I have a background in teaching and programming and am confident that I can create something that is valuable for an experienced developer who wants to learn something new.
